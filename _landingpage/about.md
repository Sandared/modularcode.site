This site is intended to be a curated collection of resources for learning OSGi. 

*"Really? OSGi? Are you kidding me? My boss/colleague/friend/scary neighbour said that's s******"*

Well maybe your (insert above here) was right 10-15 years ago. OSGi was ... let's say tough at that times. But it evolved!
And currently with version 7 it has reached a state where it is a magnificent framework, at least on par with your other favorite frameworks out there - maybe even better.

Nevertheless, the documentation on how to get started with OSGi is still not perfect and that's where this website comes into play.
It provides all the resources that I wished I had from the beginning.
Also I will add here and there some explanations for dummies (like me) to get you started as easy as possible.

That said, you should give OSGi a try in its current state and then judge again. Maybe you will be surprised.
