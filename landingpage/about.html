<p><em>“Really? OSGi? Are you kidding me? My boss/colleague/friend/scary neighbour said that’s s</em><em>****”</em></p>

<p>Well maybe your (insert above here) was right 10-15 years ago. OSGi was … let’s say tough at that times. But it evolved!
And currently with version 7 it has reached a state where it is a magnificent framework, at least on par with your other favorite frameworks out there - maybe even better.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the documentation on how to get started with OSGi is still not perfect and that’s where this website comes into play.
It provides all the resources that I wished I had from the beginning.
Also I will add here and there some explanations for dummies (like me) to get you started as easy as possible.</p>

<p>That said, you should give OSGi a try in its current state and then judge again. Maybe you will be surprised.</p>
